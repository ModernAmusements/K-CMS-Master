Description: I created and directed a campaign for fashion retailer Zalando, designing and building a 3D world as well as directing a photo and video shoot. The product and models from the shoot were placed into the 'Sneakernet' environment, which adapted to the hero product in each scene. Working as an animated and stills campaign it ran across the Zalando homepage for four weeks.
