Description: Das Programm researches Braun Design 1955-1995 (the period of Dieter Rams’ directorship). Our activities span writing projects, exhibition curation and the supply of objects to museums – amongst others, the London Design Museum, Vitra Museum, Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum and the HfG Ulm Archive. Stocked with over 550 Braun objects, from ‘60s audio equipment to ‘80s shavers, Das Programm’s website combines archive, reference book and educational resource.
