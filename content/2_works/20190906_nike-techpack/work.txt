Concept: Fascinated by technical materials and utilitarian clothing, Christopher RÃ¦burn designed a series of original pieces using decommissioned military parachutes. In collaboration with Timberland, the collection is inspired by these original pieces and made with organic and recycled materials. Golgotha produced the film that accompanied the launch of this new capsule collection.
