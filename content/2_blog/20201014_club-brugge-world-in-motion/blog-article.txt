        The new look and feel adds a
        contemporary edge to the club’s
        branding. Arrows are used to great
        effect, combined with bold typography, a
        more stylised approach to photography,
        and a strong colour palette – led by
        the club’s traditional blue and black,
        with flashes of white. Motion graphics
        are crisp and dynamic, with snappy
        transitions suggesting a positive
        attitude. The arrows became a unifying
        graphic motif across the various teams
        in the Club Brugge family – including
        CLUB YLA (the women’s team) and CLUB
        NXT (the youth academy).

Description: Founded in 1891, Club Brugge is one of Belgium’s oldest and most successful football clubs, winning the league on 16 occasions. The club has become a regular feature in the UEFA Champions League – a prestigious competition with a global audience. Seeking to meet the media demands placed upon today’s elite clubs, especially in the digital realm, Club Brugge chose Studio Dumbar to refresh its brand.
