Description: Paris-based Étienne Garachon is a Franco-Swiss jewellery designer. In 2015, he worked with Golgotha to design a 3D jewellery collection, Glass & Gold. The series featured earrings and a necklace with a sleek design that emphasised the materials used. Framed in black and white, the eyes are drawn to the detailed interplay between transparency and the finish of the materials.
