Concept:

The poems are written by Henry Ponder, a minor British poet who majors in finding interest in the everyday. Naresh Ramchandani and team produced two films about Henry’s poems ‘Mind your Head’ and ‘Henry Ponder goes to Cannes’ back in 2016.

While working from home, the team returned to Henry’s work and found many poems that celebrated the beauty and wonder of the ordinary things to be found in home life.
